Lab and HW area for BIS015L.

About me:
I'm a biochemistry and molecular biology major and some of the other courses I am taking this quarter are CHE2B, MAT17B, and UWP1. I chose to take this class because I am not too sure what I want to do after college. Hopefully, I can use this experience to get some idea of what career I want. That being said I have literally zero experience in coding so please don't judge this repository too harshly.
